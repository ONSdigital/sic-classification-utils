"""Module for generating prompt templates for SIC classification tasks.

This module provides various prompt templates for tasks related to the classification
of respondent data into UK SIC (Standard Industry Classification) codes. The prompts
are designed to work with the LangChain library and include configurations for
different use cases, such as determining SIC codes, re-ranking SIC codes, and handling
ambiguous classifications.

The module includes:
- Core prompt templates for SIC classification tasks.
- Support for partial variables and format instructions.
- Integration with Pydantic models for structured output parsing.

Attributes:
    SIC_PROMPT_PYDANTIC (PromptTemplate): Template for determining SIC codes based on
        respondent data.
    SIC_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining SIC codes with a relevant
        subset of SIC codes provided.
    SA_SIC_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining a list of most likely
        SIC codes with confidence scores.
    GENERAL_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining custom classification
        codes with a relevant subset of codes provided.
    SIC_PROMPT_UNAMBIGUOUS (PromptTemplate): Template for evaluating if a 5-digit SIC
        code can be assigned with high confidence.
    SIC_PROMPT_RERANKER (PromptTemplate): Template for re-ranking and selecting the most
        relevant SIC codes based on semantic similarity and business context alignment.

Analyze each candidate SIC code's relevance to the query.
Score each candidate on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on semantic similarity and
business context alignment.
Select the top N most relevant codes.
Provide clear reasoning for your scoring decisions.
Your response must be a single JSON object with NO additional text or formatting.

===Scoring Criteria===

Primary Activity Match (0.0-0.4):

Evaluates the fundamental alignment between the query and the code's main
business activity

Scoring guidelines:

0.35-0.4: Perfect match (e.g., "Beer brewery" → "Manufacture of beer")
0.25-0.34: Strong match with minor differences (e.g., "Craft brewery" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.15-0.24: Related activity in same sector (e.g., "Beer distribution" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.05-0.14: Tangentially related activity (e.g., "Beer tasting" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.0-0.04: Minimal or no relation to primary activity


Context Precision (0.0-0.3):

Measures how specifically the code captures the business context of the query
Considers industry position (manufacturing, wholesale, retail, service)
Scoring guidelines:

0.25-0.3: Exact business context match (e.g., manufacturing vs. retail context)
0.15-0.24: Related context with same business model
0.05-0.14: Similar industry but different business model
0.0-0.04: Different business context entirely


Examples:

Query "Beer shop" matching "Retail sale of beverages" (high precision)
Query "Beer shop" matching "Wholesale of beverages" (medium precision)
Query "Beer shop" matching "Manufacture of beer" (low precision)


Example Activity Alignment (0.0-0.3):

Evaluates matches between query and specific example activities listed under the code
Considers both exact matches and semantic similarity

Scoring guidelines:

0.25-0.3: Direct match with example activities
0.15-0.24: Semantic equivalence to example activities
0.05-0.14: Partial overlap with example activities
0.0-0.04: No matching example activities


Special considerations:

Multiple matching examples increase score within range
Industry-specific terminology matches are weighted heavily
Generic matches receive lower scores

===Input Data===
- Company's main activity: {industry_descr}
- Job Title: {job_title}
- Job Description: {job_description}
- Number of codes to select (N): {n}

===UK SIC 2007 candidates===
{sic_index}

===Requirements===

Scores must be between 0.0 and 1.0
Selected codes must be exactly N in number
All codes must receive a score and reasoning
Reasoning must reference specific aspects of the code and query
Scores should reflect relative relevance between codes

You are tasked with assigning UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes to survey
responses with high confidence.

Key objective: You MUST assign a 5-digit SIC code from the candidates provided. Only provide a higher-level
code if multiple candidates have nearly identical confidence scores (within 0.2 of each other) AND no single
can be identified as the clear best match.

Assignment logic:
1. Default behavior: Assign the highest-confidence 5-digit SIC code from the candidates.
2. Higher-level code exception: Only if two or more codes have confidence scores within 0.2
 of each other AND you cannot determine a clear winner. Provide the most granular
higher-level code with X padding to 5-digits (e.g., 8610X for 4-digit confidence, 86XXX for
3-digit confidence, 8XXXX for 2-digit confidence).
3. 95% confidence interpretation: This means "more likely than not" given the available evidence -
not absolute certainty.

Key principles:
1. Focus on Best Fit: Rather than seeking absolute certainty, identify which code best fits the totality of evidence.
2. Prioritise information on employer of the respondent rather than their specific role.
3. Be Decisive: The goal is accurate classification, not perfect certainty. If evidence clearly points to one
code over others, assign it confidently.

Important: When a respondent's closed question answer directly matches or closely aligns with a SIC code
description, this constitutes strong evidence for that code.

Follow these steps in order:
1. Review all available information - respondent data, candidate SIC codes, and follow-up responses.
2. Evaluate each candidate SIC code against all available evidence.
3. Assign confidence scores - Rate each candidate from 0.1 (least likely) to 0.9 (most likely).
Weight respondent's own descriptions heavily.
4. Apply assignment logic - Select the candidate with the highest confidence score as your primary assignment.
Only consider higher-level coding if multiple candidates have nearly identical scores (within 0.2) and you cannot
differentiate between them.
5. Determine final assignment - Assign best fitting 5-digit code or the most specific higher-level code.
6. Provide clear reasoning - Explain your decision with specific evidence.

- Job Title: {job_title}
- Job Description: {job_description}

===LLM output===

===Quality standards===
Language and Clarity
- Use simple, natural language that is easy to understand
- Use plain English - define or avoid technical jargon
- Be specific about what information is sought - avoid vague terms
- Use concise, grammatically correct phrasing
- Specify time frames clearly when relevant (e.g., "currently," "in your main job")
- Refer to employer as "employer" or "organisation" (e.g. "services your organisation offers")

Question Structure
- **REQUIRED: Focus on the employer's main business activities, products, or services rather
than the specific job role**
- **REQUIRED: Start questions with open-ended phrases such as "What," "How," "Which," "Where,"
"Please explain," or "Please describe"**
- Vary your question starters and actively choose from different opening phrases to create
natural variation
- Limit question to one sentence
- Ask only one thing at a time - avoid double-barreled questions
- AVOID binary A/B questions or "either/or" structures
- Provide sufficient context for understanding the question
- Focus on factual information rather than hypothetical situations

Respondent Considerations
- Formulate questions in such a way that a respondent can answer them easily in a few words
- Only ask for information the respondent would reasonably know
- Don't assume knowledge or circumstances that may not apply
- Avoid requiring complex mental calculations

Neutrality and Bias
- Use neutral wording that doesn't suggest a "correct" answer
- Avoid leading the respondent toward particular responses
- Keep phrasing positive and straightforward - don't use double negatives

===Example Questions===
- "What is the age range of the students that you teach?"
- "How would you describe the main products your employer manufactures?"
